## Description

  ###### What I plan to do
  Regarding my actual coding skills, I aim to do something not too complicated, based on procedural generation and physical behavior, 
  or fractal pattern generation, with (maybe) sonic induced behaviors and colorisation. 
  

## Resources
###### Rope physics

  The movement of the ropes induced by the shpere's behavior is really interesting and I like the visual of it, but I think it could need some
  organic/natural movement. I am thinking about how whales disturb the water surface when they come to breath.
  
###### Fractal flowers generation

  I may not be able to come up with the flowers settings part, but it's still interesting, I really like the art style and the visual of it. 
It could be coupled to a form generation thing, and have a floral forms of animals/people.

######Portrait Generation

  The code has been made in Processing, but it shows how dynamic it would be if coupled with the fractal flowers generation one.
  
######Generative (Bonus)

Overall, I am aiming for a generative art thing.
